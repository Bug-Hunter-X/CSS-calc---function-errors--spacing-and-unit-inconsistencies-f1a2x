The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes the calculation might not be performed correctly if there are spaces around the operators. For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px)` will work correctly, but `width: calc( 100% - 20px )` may not, depending on the browser.  Another issue is the incorrect use of units within the `calc()` function. You must use consistent units, i.e., you can't subtract pixels from percentages directly without proper unit conversion.
